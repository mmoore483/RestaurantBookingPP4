# A Restaurant Booking - The Moore Hen
Portfolio Project 4 Full Stack Toolkit - Code Institute

# About
The Moore Hen is a fictional restaurant set in the vast expanse of the North York Moors, a place to rest for weary travellers and to celebrate with friends with food, drink and a roaring fire. Ever popular, the restaurant requires an app with integrated booking service to manage bookings and avoid disappointment for customers.

# User Experience
The app will largely be managed by the restaurant staff and thus has two main user perspectives: customers and the business.
